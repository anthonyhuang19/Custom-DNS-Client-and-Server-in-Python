# 🚀 CDN Cache API — A Lightweight Caching Layer for Content Delivery

Welcome to the **CDN Cache API** project! This repository contains a robust caching system designed to simulate key CDN caching behaviors — including TTL-based expiration, LRU eviction, and an HTTP API interface for cache management. Perfect for learning, testing, or extending to production-grade systems!

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Content Delivery Network (CDN) cache layer** that:

- Efficiently caches HTTP responses with **time-to-live (TTL)** management
- Supports **Least Recently Used (LRU)** eviction when cache reaches capacity
- Differentiates cache entries by HTTP method & request path
- Provides a **FastAPI**-based HTTP interface to interact with the cache
- Includes a simulated backend server to mimic origin responses for testing
- Comes with a comprehensive **pytest** suite to ensure stability and correctness

 ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Create and activate** a Python 3.9+ virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   .\env\Scripts\activate    # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Running the Application
Launch the FastAPI app locally with hot reload support:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --reload
Open your browser or API client at http://localhost:8000 to access the API.

🧪 Running Tests
Ensure your virtual environment is activated, then:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest test.py -v
Or run the test script directly:

bash
Copy
Edit
./test.sh
Note: The test suite covers 30+ scenarios including cache hits/misses, eviction policies, TTL expiration, and API correctness.

⚠️ Known Issues / To-Do
Some tests currently fail, highlighting areas for improvement:

API root endpoint response format

Cache metadata inclusion consistency

Cache key differentiation for HTTP methods

Backend error handling in API responses

These are documented in the test code for further debugging and enhancement.

📌 Key Features
TTL Cache: Automatically expires cache entries after a configurable duration.

LRU Eviction: When capacity is full, least recently used items are removed.

Multi-Method Support: Cache keys include HTTP method to avoid collisions.

API Metadata: Responses include cache hit status and cache keys for transparency.

Test-Driven: Comprehensive automated tests to maintain code quality.

Modular Design: Easily extend cache policies or API features.
